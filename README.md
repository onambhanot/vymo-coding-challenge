# vymo-coding-challenge
 The first part of the notebook uses simple Python data structures like lists,dictionaries,strings and the various functions associated with it.The second part of the notebook uses Pandas to perform simple manipulation between two arrays, loading data from csv files, and manipulation on csv files. The third part of notebook uses Numpy.
 
# Prerequisites
In order to better view and work, I encourage you to use Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter Notebook application allows you to create and edit documents that display the input and output of a Python or R language script.
You will also need to download the Numpy and Pandas packages.

# Data
The first part of project does not require any external dataset . However the Numpy and Pandas one does require Purchases and Prices data in order to work. Data is already provided in the Folder data in the form of 2 .csv files(purchases, prices), but feel free to use any other data you wish by doing the appropraite modifications.
